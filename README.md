# Projekt nr.1 procesy stochastyczne

My project was to create a program doing the written tasks in the "projekt 1.png" file for the patient in the decade 70.

## How to run this project

### Setting up virtual environment and installing requirements

After cloning the repository set up virtual environment:

In Windows (the author's setup):

```
python -m venv venv 
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In Linux:

```
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Runing the project:

After creating the environment, the project can be run by running the "Run" file and inputting the path to the data. 
The program tooks approximately 1-2 hours on mediocre setup.
